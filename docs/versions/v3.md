# v3 — Explainability and Causal Reporting

## Goal

Ensure every enforcement action is human-explainable.

---

## What Exists

- Decision logs
- Causal chains
- `rgov explain`-style output

---

## What Is Explicitly Forbidden

- Statistical explanations
- Probabilistic reasoning
- Vague summaries
- “Best effort” explanations

---

## Required Evidence

v3 is complete only when:

- Every throttle can be explained via:
  - observed `U_w`
  - violated invariant
  - applied rule
- Explanations are reproducible via replay
- No explanation depends on intuition or inference

---

## Success Criteria

If a user asks “why was this throttled?”  
the system must answer precisely or refuse.
