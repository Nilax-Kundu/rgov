# v0 — Policy Simulator

## Goal

Prove that the CPU policy state machine is:
- internally coherent
- deterministic
- replayable
- invariant-preserving

No kernel interaction is permitted.

---

## What Exists

- CPU policy state machine
- Enforcement window logic (pure)
- Replay harness
- Synthetic `U_w` generators

---

## What Is Explicitly Forbidden

- Any OS interaction
- Any cgroups code
- Any clocks or timers
- Any real workloads
- Any concurrency

---

## Required Evidence

v0 is complete only when:

- All policy invariants are asserted and never violated
- Replay of identical `U_w` sequences produces identical results
- Adversarial sequences (infinite overshoot, oscillation, zero usage) are handled correctly
- Policy can run for arbitrarily many windows without drift

---

## Non-Goals

- Performance
- Realism
- Integration

If v0 fails, all later versions are invalid.
