# v2 — Multiple Independent Workloads

## Goal

Prove that policy scales by replication, not coupling.

---

## What Exists

- N independent workloads
- Independent policy state per workload
- Global capacity validation (pre-check only)

---

## What Is Explicitly Forbidden

- Cross-workload policy
- Fairness logic
- Rebalancing
- Shared debt
- Negotiation between workloads

---

## Required Evidence

v2 is complete only when:

- Adding/removing a workload does not affect others under valid capacity
- Capacity violations are detected and reported
- Replay remains valid with interleaved workloads
- No shared state emerges

---

## Failure Mode

If workloads interfere at the policy level, the design is invalid.
