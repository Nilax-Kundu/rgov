# v4 — Memory Resource Introduction

## Goal

Extend the architecture to a second resource without weakening CPU guarantees.

---

## Preconditions

v4 may begin only if:
- v0–v3 are complete
- CPU behavior is stable and documented

---

## What Exists

- Memory observation
- Memory enforcement
- Memory policy state machine

---

## What Is Explicitly Forbidden

- Cross-resource coupling
- CPU behavior changes
- Implicit priority shifts

---

## Required Evidence

v4 is complete only when:

- Memory invariants are defined and preserved
- Memory behavior is explainable
- CPU invariants remain unchanged
