# v1 — Single Workload Kernel Binding

## Goal

Bind the policy to Linux exactly once and observe real kernel behavior.

---

## What Exists

- One real workload
- One cgroup
- Observation via `cpu.stat:usage_usec`
- Enforcement via `cpu.max`
- Fixed enforcement window

---

## What Is Explicitly Forbidden

- Multiple workloads
- Cross-workload logic
- Background threads
- Async policy execution
- Additional kernel signals

---

## Required Evidence

v1 is complete only when:

- Overshoot ≤ one enforcement window in practice
- Replay results match policy-only simulation
- Accounting lag is measured and documented
- cpu.max enforcement behaves idempotently
- Invariants hold under sustained load

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Kernel introduces noise, not semantic breaks
- Bounds may be conservative, not violated

If kernel behavior contradicts assumptions, the spec must be updated.
